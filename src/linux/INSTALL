The easiest way to get BFF up and running is to use the UbuFuzz
virtual machine.  However, if this is not an option for you, it should
possible to run BFF on any UNIX-like operating system, as long as the
dependencies are met.

===== Dependencies =====

For basic fuzzing functionality, the following packages are required:
Python 2.7
Python Numpy
Python Scipy
Python Yaml
gdb (7.2 or later on Linux is required for exploitability information)
zzuf (patched by CERT)

In order to build zzuf and the other BFF dependencies, the following
packages may be required:
svn
gcc
make
automake
libtool
gcc-c++
ncurses-devel

For additional analysis tools that can be used during or after a
fuzzing campaign, the following packages are required:
Python hcluster
Python matplotlib


===== Filesystem layout =====

By default, BFF will use the following filesystem locations:
For the location of the scripts (including bff.py):
~/bff

For the results:
~/bff/results

The default fuzzing target of ImageMagick:
~/convert

All of these locations can be symlinks.


===== Beginning a fuzzing campaign =====

Simply run ~/bff/batch.sh to start fuzzing.


===== Tuning the operating system =====

UbuFuzz has several optimizations that improve fuzzing performance.
If using your own operating system, you may wish to make the following
changes:

- The Fluxbox window manager is used instead of the heavy Gnome or KDE
  desktop environments.

- Fluxbox is configured to not raise or focus new windows. This can
  help in situations where you may need to interact with the guest OS
  while a GUI application is being fuzzed.

- Memory randomization is disabled (kernel.randomize_va_space = 0 in
  /etc/sysctl.conf).  This helps remove duplicate crashes where the
  target application does not have debug symbols.

- VMware Tools is installed, which allows the guest OS to share a
  directory with the host.

- The OS is configured to automatically log in and start X.

- sudo is configured to not prompt for a password.

- strip is symlinked to /bin/true, which prevents symbols from being
  removed when an application is built.

===== Installation on other platforms =====

BFF should run on any UNIX-like operating system. Depending on the features
supported by the OS, certain BFF capabilities may not be available. For
example, CERT Triage Tools exploitability determination only functions on
Linux.

The minimum requirements to be able to run BFF are:
Python 2.7
Python Numpy
Python Scipy
Python Yaml
gdb (7.2 or later on Linux is required for exploitability information)
zzuf (patched by CERT)

Patches may be required to get zzuf compiled on non-Linux systems.
